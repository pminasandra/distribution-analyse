# distribution-analyse

## Contents
This is a small piece of code written in python3. It can be used to perform the analyses in [Minasandra & Isvaran (2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/10/411199) using one command, on your own data. 
This code heavily relies on code used by [Alsott et al (2014)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085777), and their python module, `powerlaw`. The code comes along with an installer (`install`) to help those unfamiliar with the command-line.

As of now (09-Sep-2018), the code works only on linux systems, but can be tweaked to run on windows with a few modifications. Please read [INSTALLATION_README](https://github.com/pminasandra/distribution-analyse/blob/master/INSTALLATION_README) for details on installation.

# distribution-analyse

This is a small piece of code written in python 3. It can be used to perform the analyses in Minasandra & Isvaran (2018) using one command, on your own data. 
This code heavily relies on code used by Alsott et al (2014), and their python module, powerlaw.
The code comes along with an installer to help those unfamiliar with the command-line.

As of now (09-Sep-2018), the code works only on linux systems, but can be tweaked to run on windows with a few modifications.
